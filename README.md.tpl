- **Container** – Optional. Select a container if utilized.
- **Client Machine** – Required. The server name or IP Address of the A10 vThunder API plus port.  [Azure Test Machine](https://portal.azure.com/#@csspkioutlook.onmicrosoft.com/resource/subscriptions/b3114ff1-bb92-45b6-9bd6-e4a1eed8c91e/resourceGroups/kVThunderA10/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/kVThunderA10/overview) port is :1113 for ssl.
- **Store Path** – Required.  This will be one of the following based on what you are looking to add to the store.
1. **[DomainName]\cert** where [DomainName] is the name of the domain in A10 vThunder you are looking to manage and inventory.

2.  **cert** - This will use the default domain in A10 vThunder to manage and inventory **domain** certs

3. **[DomainName]\pubcert** - This will give you the ability to Inventory the Pub Cert Folder on the specified domain where [DomainName] is the name of the domain in A10 vThunder you are looking to inventory.  

4. **pubcert** - This will use the default domain in A10 vThunder to manage and inventory **public certs** certs

### App Config Settings
Keyfactor.AnyAgent.vThunder.dll.config (Deployed with all AnyAgent Binaries)
```
<appSettings>
    <!--Should be https, made configurable in case needed for dev or whatever-->
    <add key="Protocol" value="https" />
    <!--true for debugging/testing on Azure VM since the cert will be invalid at .eastus.cloudapp.azure.com should be false in Production with a valid cert-->
    <add key="AllowInvalidCerts" value="true" />
</appSettings>
```

There are 2 App Config Settings
1. Protocol should always be **https** in **Production** but you may need to switch to **http** for **Testing** only

2. AllowInvalidCerts should be set to **false** in **Production**.  It is set to **true** in **Dev/Test** since the VM we are testing with a vThunder VM that does not have a valid SSL Certificate on the Azure Platform.
