## Overview

### ðŸ”’ SSL Certificates

**Purpose:**  
Used for securing traffic that passes through the device (i.e., traffic handled by SLB/ADC features).

**Usage Context:**  
- SSL Offloading
- SSL Intercept (Decryption/Encryption)
- Reverse proxy configurations

**Configured In:**  
- **GUI:** `ADC â†’ Ssl Management


**Example:**  
If the A10 is acting as an SSL offloader for a backend web server, the **SSL Certificate** is used to terminate client HTTPS sessions.


## Requirements

### Creating a User for API Access on A10 vThunder

This guide explains how to create a user on A10 vThunder for API (AXAPI) access with appropriate privileges.

#### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Enter configuration mode:**
   ```bash
   configure terminal
   ```

2. **Create the user and set a password:**
   ```bash
   admin apiuser password yourStrongPassword
   ```

   Replace `apiuser` with the desired username, and `yourStrongPassword` with a secure password.

3. **Assign necessary privileges:**
   ```bash
   privilege read
   privilege write
   privilege partition-enable-disable
   privilege partition-read
   privilege partition-write
   ```

   These privileges grant the user:
   - Global read and write access
   - Per-partition read and write access
   - Permission to enable or disable partitions

4. **(Optional) Enable external health monitor privilege (if needed):**
   ```bash
   privilege hm
   ```

5. **Exit user configuration:**
   ```bash
   exit
   ```

#### Notes

- This user will now be able to authenticate and perform actions via A10's AXAPI (v2/v3) interface.
- Role-Based Access (RBA) and partition assignment can further fine-tune access control.

#### Example Login via AXAPI

Example using `curl` for AXAPI v3 login:
```bash
curl -X POST https://<vThunder-IP>/axapi/v3/auth \
  -d '{"credentials":{"username":"apiuser","password":"yourStrongPassword"}}' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```
