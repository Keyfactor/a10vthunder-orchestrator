## Overview

The Keyfactor A10 vThunder Universal Orchestrator Extension facilitates the management of SSL certificates on A10 Networks' vThunder appliances. It offers two primary certificate store types:

1. **ThunderSsl**: Manages SSL certificates for securing traffic handled by the device, such as in SSL offloading, SSL intercept, and reverse proxy configurations.
2. **ThunderMgmt**: Manages certificates securing HTTPS access to the A10 management interface (GUI/API).

- **A10 Thunder Version**: Tested with A10 Thunder v6.0.5-P5 (Build 51).
- **Automated Certificate Deployment**: Streamlines the deployment of SSL certificates to the A10 vThunder appliance.
- **Certificate Inventory Management**: Provides visibility into existing certificates on the appliance.
- **Integration with Keyfactor Command**: Enables centralized certificate lifecycle management.

The a10vThunder Universal Orchestrator extension implements 2 Certificate Store Types. Depending on your use case, you may elect to use one, or both of these Certificate Store Types. Descriptions of each are provided below.

<details><summary>A10 Thunder Ssl Certificates (ThunderSsl)</summary>


### ThunderSsl

#### üîí SSL Certificates

**Purpose:**  
Used for securing traffic that passes through the device (i.e., traffic handled by SLB/ADC features).

**Usage Context:**  
- SSL Offloading
- SSL Intercept (Decryption/Encryption)
- Reverse proxy configurations

**Configured In:**  
- **GUI:** `ADC ‚Üí Ssl Management


**Example:**  
If the A10 is acting as an SSL offloader for a backend web server, the **SSL Certificate** is used to terminate client HTTPS sessions.
</details>

<details><summary>A10 Thunder Management Certificates (ThunderMgmt)</summary>


### ThunderMgmt

#### üîê Management Certificates

**Purpose:**  
Used to secure HTTPS access to the A10 management interface (GUI/API).

**Usage Context:**  
- AXAPI (API access over HTTPS)
- Web GUI login
- Any administrative HTTPS session

**Configured In:**  
- **GUI:** `System ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Certificate`

**Example:**  
When a user logs into the GUI via `https://<device_ip>`, the certificate presented is the **Management Certificate**.

### A10 Thunder Ssl Certificates Requirements

#### Creating a User for API Access on A10 vThunder

This guide explains how to create a user on A10 vThunder for API (AXAPI) access with appropriate privileges.

##### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Enter configuration mode:**
   ```bash
   configure terminal
   ```

2. **Create the user and set a password:**
   ```bash
   admin apiuser password yourStrongPassword
   ```

   Replace `apiuser` with the desired username, and `yourStrongPassword` with a secure password.

3. **Assign necessary privileges:**
   ```bash
   privilege read
   privilege write
   privilege partition-enable-disable
   privilege partition-read
   privilege partition-write
   ```

   These privileges grant the user:
   - Global read and write access
   - Per-partition read and write access
   - Permission to enable or disable partitions

4. **(Optional) Enable external health monitor privilege (if needed):**
   ```bash
   privilege hm
   ```

5. **Exit user configuration:**
   ```bash
   exit
   ```

##### Notes

- This user will now be able to authenticate and perform actions via A10's AXAPI (v2/v3) interface.
- Role-Based Access (RBA) and partition assignment can further fine-tune access control.

##### Example Login via AXAPI

Example using `curl` for AXAPI v3 login:
```bash
curl -X POST https://<vThunder-IP>/axapi/v3/auth \
  -d '{"credentials":{"username":"apiuser","password":"yourStrongPassword"}}' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### A10 Thunder Management Certificates Requirements

#### A10 Certificate Management Orchestrator Extension

This orchestrator extension automates the process of uploading, inventorying, and deploying SSL certificates from a Linux SCP server to an A10 vThunder device. Due to A10 API limitations, certificates must be pulled from the SCP server directly by the A10 device itself.

---

##### üìå How It Works

1. **The orchestrator** connects to a Linux server via SCP to inventory available certificates.
2. It stores relevant metadata and pushes new certificates and keys to the SCP server.
3. It then instructs the **A10 device** to retrieve the certificate and private key from the Linux server using API calls.
4. The A10 device loads the certificate and key directly from the SCP server for use on its **management interface**.

---

##### üì° API Call Example (From A10 Device)

```http
POST /axapi/v3/web-service/secure/certificate
```

**Payload:**
```json
{
  "certificate": {
    "load": 1,
    "file-url": "scp://ec2-user:dda@172.31.93.107:/home/ec2-user/26125.crt"
  }
}
```

> A similar call is made for loading the private key onto the A10 device using a separate AXAPI endpoint.

- The A10 device **must have access** to the SCP server via the specified IP (`A10ToScpServerIp`).
- Ensure the certificate and key file paths are correct and accessible to the SCP user.

---

##### üîê Linux Server Requirements

###### User Access
- The SCP user (`ScpUserName`, e.g., `ec2-user`) must:
  - Have SSH/SCP access.
  - Authenticate with a password.
  - Have **read and write** permissions in the SCP location.

> New certificates and **private keys** are generated by Keyfactor and uploaded to this location by the orchestrator. Therefore, write access is essential.

###### SCP Directory Permissions
- Ensure the directory (e.g., `/home/ec2-user/`) is:
  - Writable by the orchestrator (to upload new certs/keys).
  - Readable by both the orchestrator and the A10 device (via SCP).

---

##### üîÑ Alternate Design Consideration

It may be possible to use the A10 device itself as the SCP target location if it supports read/write SCP operations **outside the CLI context**. However, A10 devices typically restrict file access through CLI or API mechanisms only, and not through standard SCP server operations. This limitation is why a separate Linux SCP server is currently required.

---

##### üîì Network and Port Requirements

| Source             | Destination         | Port | Protocol | Purpose                       |
|--------------------|---------------------|------|----------|-------------------------------|
| Orchestrator       | Linux SCP Server    | 22   | TCP      | Inventory and upload via SCP  |
| A10 Device         | Linux SCP Server    | 22   | TCP      | Cert and key retrieval via SCP|
| Orchestrator/Admin | A10 Device (API)    | 443  | HTTPS    | API calls to load certificate |

---

##### ‚úÖ Summary

This extension coordinates certificate and private key delivery by using SCP as a bridge between orchestrator logic and A10's strict API requirements. It ensures secure and automated deployment for the management interface certificates with minimal manual intervention.
